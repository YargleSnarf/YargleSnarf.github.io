</p><h2> Why 42 </h2> <p>

42 is a new programming language, whose name is inspired by The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
Why should you give 42 a try?
</p><p>
42 programs are secure, easy to optimize and customize. In 42 you get:

</a></li></ul>

More in details:
</p><p>
<ul><li>
<h5 id="SeamlessCaching">Seamless caching</h5>
Most of the performance issues are not about smart ways to generate ultra fast assembly.
Most often they are about code repeating the same operations over and over again.
In 42 various forms of caching are proven semantically unobservable.
This means that those optimizations are easy to insert and are unable
to induce bugs into the system.
</li><li>
<h5 id="DeterministicParallelism">Deterministic parallelism</h5>
Caching and parallelism are the two main ways to optimize code.
While caching avoids doing the same operation over and over again,
parallelism allows doing more things at the same time.
In other languages, parallelism allows for non deterministic behaviour;
that is a nightmare to debug, especially when it is unintentional.

In 42 all parallelism is deterministic by construction,
thus no bugs can be caused by the quirks of parallel execution.
This allows us to take full advantage of many cores while keeping the simple deterministic and
sequential execution model in mind when testing and debugging code.
</li><li>
<h5 id="TypedClassDecorators">Typed class decorators</h5>
In a typical 42 program, the huge majority of the code is
automatically generated by user defined class decorators.
This allows for exceptionally compact programs, like a fully 3-tier application in less then 100 lines.
Instead of providing the full code, a code decorator takes a suggestion (a fragment of the full code)
and produces the full result.
In this way the programmer can focus the majority of their time
on writing the important bits of their code,
while redundant and repetitive code is automatically generated.
</li><li>
<h5 id="AlwaysOnConstraints">Always-on constraints</h5>
<q>Personal names start with an upper-case letter</q>,
<q>Those two lists have the same size</q>,
<q>This map contains an entry for all the cities of Japan</q>.
When writing code, we often assume our input data to satisfy certain expectations.
In 42 we can encode those expectations as user defined constraints on the data,
and it is then impossible to observe broken constraints.
In this way the data we work on can never become ill formed.
</li><li>
<h5 id="FineGrainedPermissions">Fine grained permissions</h5>
A secure program never does the wrong action.
For example, it never commits ill-formed data to the database.
In 42 a single localized part of code can clearly specify what those actions are
and what are the corresponding correctness criteria.
The rest of the code will be unable to break those criteria, and thus be unable to perform wrong actions.
In this way the programmer can focus the majority of their time on writing correct software,
while the security is guaranteed by the system.
This has pervasive security implications: in a large application, the most experienced programmer can 
write those constraints. Other programmers and library code will be unable to break those constraints,
no matter how hard they could try.
</li><li>
<h5 id="IntegratedDeployment">Integrated deployment</h5>
In other languages, writing a program is just the first step.
The program will need to be then tested and uploaded so that clients can use it.
This usually requires using a plethora of different tools.
This is not the case in 42: A typical 42 program will compile, test and deploy itself.
In 42 everything about an application is encoded by the code of that application.
</li><li>
<h5 id="NoNeedOfSystemKnowledge">No need of system knowledge</h5>
42 is designed from the ground up to avoid the need of any system knowledge:
A good 42 programmer just need to be good at designing code.
On the other side, to be a good programmer in other languages, you would also need to
know about shell commands, operative system conventions, environment variables, character encodings
and anything else usually connected with a specific operative system.
</li><li>
<h5 id="Towels">Towels!</h5>
Not all projects have the same requirements, and not all the developers have the same preferences.
Most languages are stuck with a single standard library,
that ends up being obsolete after a few years.
In 42, towels cover the same role of the standard library,
but towels can be personalized, to fit better a given company, project or programmer.
Methods and classes can be added, removed or simply renamed.
This can be done while preserving compatibility with the all of the third party libraries.
The same features allowing programmatic refactoring of the towel can be used on smaller units of code,
allowing to reuse, compose and customize code in a very flexible way.
